    "### Idea of the naive Bayes classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us remember that the classification mean finding an appropriate label for a new data record.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that we have a dataset of $n$ features (table with $n$ columns). \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us denote as $(A_1, A_2, \\ldots A_n)$ a row from this table. In the other word, this is a record describing one entity in the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data are assumed to be categorical. For example $A_1$ can denote a size of a fruit: \"big\", \"medium\" or \"small\", and $A_2$ can encode its color like \"red\", \"green\" or \"yellow\". Or something like that.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general $A_i$ can have an integer value from a certain range. For the sake of simplicity in what follows will often assume that $A_i$ can be either 0 or 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us denote via $B$ a class label. For example it can be \"apple\", or \"orange\" or \"tomato\". \n",
    "\n",
    "In general this is also an integer that encodes a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $A_i$ and $B$ are categorical and have finite ranges of integer values in principle we can consider all possible combinations\n",
    "of $(A_1, A_2, \\ldots A_n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example if $A_i$ can be 0 or 1 and there are three features, i.e., $n=3$, there are 8 combinations:\n",
    "- 000\n",
    "- 001\n",
    "- 010\n",
    "- 011\n",
    "- 100\n",
    "- 101\n",
    "- 110\n",
    "- 111\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are able to collect all combinations and assign a label $B$ to each one then we do not need machine learning at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a new record is obtained we just can look at the dataset and find the corresponding label.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Of course this will be the case only if our list of features is comprehensive. Otherwise same combinations can appear in different classes and we will need some probabilistic model.)\n",
    "\n",
    "But if $n$ is large it is impossible to collect and label all possible combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we classify a new data record $(A_1, A_2, \\ldots A_n)$ if we have an incomplete labeled dataset that does not contain this combination?\n",
    "\n",
    "When we solve this problem using a naive Bayes classifiers we compute probabilities that a new data record belongs to each of the existing classes and then choose the one with the largest value of the probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is also known as maximum likelihood estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The staring point of the analysis is a Bayes' theorem. This theorem allows to compute conditional probability. \n",
    "\n",
    "However the naive Bayes classifier can compute only an approximate estimation of the probability. \n",

    "- Text classification, spam filtering, sentiment analysis: Naive Bayes classifiers mostly used in text classification (due to better result in multi class problems and independence rule) have higher success rate as compared to other algorithms. As a result, it is widely used in Spam filtering (identify spam e-mail) and Sentiment Analysis (in social media analysis, to identify positive and negative customer sentiments)\n",

    "Split the data set into training, validation and test data. Select the best model using the validation dataset and then compute your final score on the testing data. To improve the model for example the whole message content can be taken into account instead of the subject only. Also lengths of tokens that are taken into account can be varied. May be it would be interesting to split the messages into digramms: couples of words going one after another. And so on.\n",

    "5\\. Previously we discussed that in the most cases data must be standardized before creation of a machine learning model. Why it does not influences the performance of a Gaussian naive Bayes classifier?"
